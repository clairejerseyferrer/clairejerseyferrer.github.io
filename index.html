        <h2>"The Simple Things" by Michael Carreon<br/>Song Lyrics</h2>
        <br/>
    <ul> 
    <li>And it's the simple things you do</li>
    <li>I just can't get enough of you</li>
    <li>It's that perfume that you wear</li> 
    <li>And the way you do your hair</li>
    <li>That I love so much</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>And it's the simple things you say</li>
    <li>And how in bed we play</li>
    <li>It's the way you kiss my cheek</li>
    <li>When you think that I'm asleep</li> 
    <li>I love it so much</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>"I love you", words I never say</li>
    <li>Friends make fun but I tell you every day</li> 
    <li>Anyway, lately you've been getting me home safely</li>
    <li>Wake up, love the coffee that you make me</li>
    <li>Ask me how my night was, I like us, it's so easy</li> 
    <br/><br/>

    <li>And we don't ever fight 'cause</li>
    <li>You don't blow up my phone when you're home alone</li>
    <li>Assuming that I'm doing what a guy does</li>
    <li>Trust, with just the right amount of lust</li>
    <li>Even loved by my family, that's a must and fun</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>Everything we do me and you</li>
    <li>My song comes on and you dance and sing too</li>
    <li>With the windows down like G's</li>
    <li>We don't care who's around or who sees</li>
    <li>And everyone is jealous of my ride</li>
    <li>Because you're sitting in the passenger side</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>And it's the simple things you do</li>
    <li>I just can't get enough of you</li>
    <li>It's that perfume that you wear</li> 
    <li>And the way you do your hair</li>
    <li>That I love so much</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>And it's the simple things you say</li>
    <li>And how in bed we play</li>
    <li>It's the way you kiss my cheek</li>
    <li>When you think that I'm asleep</li> 
    <li>I love it so much</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>Everyday scrubbing it, loving it</li>
    <li>Cruisin' freeways in our PJs 'cause that's the fun of it</li>
    <li>Unless, you wear that pretty black dress, oh yes</li>
    <li>Catch me in a suit so I can look as good as you but I don't</li>
    <li>Oh well, with that smile that you wear so well</li>
    <li>And the way that you cry in movies</li>
    <li>Pass you the ball and you pass it back to me</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>Beers with the guys ain't nothing</li>
    <li>It's your eyes and the simple things</li>
    <li>That make this work like it should</li>
    <li>When you rock my shirt, oh you look so good</li>
    <li>So take my hand and stay as long as you can</li>
    <li>With the man that tells all the jokes only you understand</li>
    <li>And I promise to be honest if you promise to accomplish love</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>All we need is love</li>
    <li>I just can't get enough of you</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>It's that perfume that you wear</li>
    <li>And the way you do your hair</li>
    <li>That I love so much</li>
    <br/><br/>

    <li>And it's the simple things you say</li>
    <li>And how in bed we play</li>
    <li>It's the way you kiss my cheek</li>
    <li>When you think that I'm asleep</li>
    <li>I love it so much</li>
